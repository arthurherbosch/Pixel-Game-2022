## Pixelated game 
# made by Arthur Herbosch

This is an ungoing project! I have just developed the basic movements of the game

Things I am working now:
**different levels inside the game**
**making a map builder, so u can easy build maps**
**Add some rewards and customization to the game**


I used Python 3 for this game. Just run the python file and you will be able to play the game!
